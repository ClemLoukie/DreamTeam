Feature: Add a Task to a Course Todo List

    As a student, I add a task to a course to do list, so I can remember it.
    
    Background: Server is running, TODOs and HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priority categories are created
        Given the server is running
        And TODOs with the following details exist
            | title                  | doneStatus | description       |
            | Work on group project  | false      | setup the project |
            | Finish webwork         | false      | 3 problems left   |
            | Do Shakespeare Reading | false      | Act 1 only        |
        And course todo list projects with the following details exist  
            | title                  | completed  | description     | active |
            | MATH 141               | false      | Calc 2          | true   |
            | ENGL 202               | false      | Literature      | true   |

        Scenario Outline: Add a task to a course todo list (Normal Flow)
            When a student adds a TODO with title <title> to a course todo list with name <course>
            Then the TODO with title <title> is added as a task of the course todo list with name <course>
            And the student is notified of the completion of the creation operation

        Examples:
            | title                    | doneStatus | description     | course     |
            | "Finish webwork"         | false      | 3 problems left | "MATH 141" |
            | "Do Shakespeare Reading" | false      | Act 1 only      | "ENGL 202" |

        Scenario Outline: Add a task to a course todo list after creating the course todo list (Alternative Flow)
            Given the student creates a course todo list with name <course> and description <description>
            When a student adds a TODO with title <title> to a course todo list with name <course>
            Then the TODO with title <title> is added as a task of the course todo list with name <course>
            And the student is notified of the completion of the creation operation

        Examples:
            | title                   | doneStatus | course     | description   |
            | "Work on group project" | false      | "ECSE 321" | "Intro to SE" |

        Scenario Outline: Add a non-existing task to a course todo list (Error Flow)
            Given a TODO with id <non_existing_id> does not exist
            When a student adds a TODO with id <non_existing_id> to a course todo list with name <course>
            Then the student is notified of the non-existence error with a message <message>

        Examples:
            | non_existing_id | course     | message                                                         |
            | "50"            | "MATH 141" | "Could not find parent thing for relationship todos/50/tasksof" |
